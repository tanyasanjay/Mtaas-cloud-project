    <div class="panel-body"><p align=justify>We have seen the emerging of increasingly mobile applications due to the use of mobile devices and sensors. 
	This imposes grave challenges to mobile engineers to ensure the quality of mobile testing due to the high costs and complexity for mobile testing.
	<strong>Mobile Testing as a Service (known as Mobile TaaS)</strong> provides on-demand testing services for mobile applications 
	and SaaS to support software validation and quality engineering processes by leveraging a cloud-based scalable mobile testing environment 
	to assure pre-defined given service-level-agreements (SLAs).</br></br></p>
	                 <p align=justify>Crowdsourcing means utilizing the talent of the crowd, the basic idea of crowdsourcing is to use the intelligence of the 
    public in a wide way to complete the business-related tasks that a company would normally either perform by itself or outsource to a third-party provider.Crowdsourcing is best suited for simple tasks. Especially if it is a startup, one cannot afford professional workers and they can consider the 
	concept of crowdsourcing to get their work done with an affordable price.Our service platform will run through out to support the application providers 
	and the testers to perform their activities on demand.</br></p>
					<p align=justify>MTaaS application provides users, the platform for managing,synchronizing and monitoring the App-providers and the tester activities in an efficient manner. </p>
